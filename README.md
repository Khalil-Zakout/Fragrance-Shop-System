# Fragrance-Shop-System

## Overview
The Fragrance Shop Sales Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline sales tracking, inventory management, and data analysis for a fragrance retail business. This project integrates a user-friendly graphical interface made with **Python** with robust data handling capabilities for data entry, demonstrating proficiency in Python programming, **database management (SQLite)**, and data analysis and visualization using tools like **Excel** and **Power BI**.


## Features
* **GUI**: Built with **`Tkinter`**, a **`Standalone`** application provides an easy-to-use interface for recording sales, managing inventory, and viewing key metrics.
  
* **Database Integration:** Utilizes **`SQLite`** for seamless data storage and retrieval, ensuring that all sales and inventory data are securely managed.
* **Real-Time Stock Updates:** Automatically adjusts stock levels with each sale, maintaining accurate inventory records.
* **Excel Integration:** Connects with **`Excel Power Pivot`** for advanced data analysis, including creating **`Dynamic Pivot Tables`** and **`Dashboards`**.
* **Power BI Integration:** Generates interactive dashboards in **`Power BI`** to visualize sales trends and business insights.
* **Data Analysis:** Implements **`DAX`** measures and **`SQL`** queries to analyze sales data, identifying top and least-selling fragrances.

## Workflow
#### 1) Data Entry:
  
* **Sales Recording:** User can input customer and select fragrances using the Tkinter-based GUI. Each sale is recorded with relevant details including the customer ID, fragrance ID, and sale date.
  
* **Adding Customers:** User can add new customers specifying their names, ages, and mobile phones.


#### 2) Data Storage:

* **SQLite Database:** Sales and inventory data are stored in a SQLite database. The **`Fragrances Table`** tracks inventory details such as fragrance names, prices, costs, profit, and stock levels. The **`Sales Table`** logs each transaction with unique sale IDs and timestamps, The **`Customers Table`** specifies the customer's name, age, mobile phone.

#### 3) Stock Management:

* **Real-Time Updates:** Upon recording a sale, the stock level for the corresponding fragrance is automatically decremented, ensuring that inventory counts remain accurate.

#### 4) Data Analysis:

* **Excel Integration:** Data is exported to Excel, where Power Pivot is used to create pivot tables and charts. This allows for dynamic analysis and visualization of sales data.
* **Power BI Integration:** Data is also visualized in Power BI, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards that highlight sales trends and key performance indicators.

#### 5) Reporting:

* **Dashboards:** Users can view comprehensive reports and dashboards created in Excel and Power BI. These dashboards provide insights into sales performance, top-selling fragrances, and inventory status.
